# Standardized Rapid Response Protocol for Poaching Incidents

## Purpose
To establish a unified, clear, and actionable protocol that all partner organizations must follow when a poaching incident is suspected or confirmed within a tiger conservation area. This ensures consistent, rapid, and effective response, improving the chances of apprehending poachers, securing evidence, and protecting tiger populations.

## Scope
This protocol applies to all tiger conservation areas under the partnership, including protected reserves, national parks, and community-managed forests. It covers incidents involving suspected or confirmed poaching of tigers, their prey, or other protected wildlife where tigers are at risk. The protocol is mandatory for all field staff, law enforcement agencies, and partner NGOs involved in tiger conservation.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Field Rangers and Patrol Teams
- Immediately report any signs of poaching (e.g., snares, gunshots, carcasses) using the designated communication channel.
- Secure the immediate area without disturbing potential evidence.
- Provide precise GPS coordinates and photographs if safe to do so.

### 2. Conservation Area Manager
- Receive and verify initial reports.
- Activate the Rapid Response Team (RRT) within 30 minutes of a confirmed incident.
- Coordinate with local law enforcement and forestry departments.
- Ensure all actions are documented and reported upward.

### 3. Rapid Response Team (RRT)
- A dedicated team comprising at least one wildlife veterinarian, two armed forest guards, one forensic specialist, and one community liaison officer.
- Deploy to the incident site within two hours of activation.
- Secure the site, collect evidence, and provide emergency medical care to any injured wildlife.
- Liaise with law enforcement for suspect apprehension.

### 4. Legal and Advocacy Unit
- Ensure chain of custody for all evidence.
- Prepare legal documentation for prosecution.
- Engage with media and stakeholders as per communication guidelines.

### 5. Partner Organizations (`field-ops-leads`)
- Review and provide feedback on protocol implementation.
- Share lessons learned and recommend improvements.
- Support cross-border coordination where applicable.

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Report
- Any individual who suspects poaching must immediately notify the Conservation Area Manager via the dedicated hotline (e.g., SMS, radio, mobile app).
- The report must include:
  - Location (GPS coordinates or nearest landmark)
  - Time of observation
  - Nature of suspicion (e.g., gunshot, snare, carcass)
  - Any immediate risks (e.g., armed poachers, dangerous terrain)
- The Manager logs the report in the Incident Register and assigns a unique case ID.

### 2. Verification
- Within 15 minutes, the Manager must assess the report’s credibility by contacting the informant, checking previous patterns, and consulting remote camera traps if available.
- If the report is deemed credible, the Manager proceeds to activate the RRT. If not, the Manager documents the reasoning and closes the case as a false alarm.

### 3. Team Deployment
- The Manager activates the RRT by notifying all members via group call/message.
- RRT members must acknowledge receipt and confirm readiness within 10 minutes.
- The team assembles at the designated staging area, collects standard equipment (evidence kits, firearms, medical supplies, communication gear), and proceeds to the site using the safest and fastest route.
- The Manager simultaneously alerts local law enforcement and requests support.

### 4. Evidence Securing
- Upon arrival, the RRT leader cordons off the incident site with barrier tape and restricts access to authorized personnel only.
- The forensic specialist photographs and videos the entire scene before any items are moved, including wide‑angle and close‑up shots.
- All physical evidence (snares, bullets, cartridge cases, tools, vehicle tracks, DNA samples) is collected using sterile gloves and placed in labeled, tamper‑proof containers.
- The wildlife veterinarian examines any animal carcasses, records cause of death, and takes tissue samples for laboratory analysis.
- A chain‑of‑custody form is started on‑site and signed by every person handling evidence.

### 5. Reporting
- Within 24 hours of the incident, the RRT leader submits a preliminary incident report to the Conservation Area Manager, copying the Legal Unit and the `field‑ops‑leads` team.
- The report must include:
  - Case ID, date, time, location
  - Description of the incident and evidence collected
  - Actions taken (apprehensions, medical interventions, site security)
  - Recommended next steps (legal, patrol intensification, community outreach)
- The Legal Unit ensures all evidence is transferred to the appropriate authorities and tracks the case through the judicial system.
- A follow‑up review meeting is held within one week with all stakeholders to evaluate the response and identify improvements.
